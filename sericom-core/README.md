# Sericom-core

This is the underlying library for [`sericom`](https://crates.io/crates/sericom).

As it stands right now, this library is not and has not been developed to be used
by other projects/crates. Much of the code within this library is geared specifically
towards `sericom`.

I am more than open to making this library's API better suited for use within other
projects and crates and maybe as new features are developed I will publish them as
library "features" to allow users to opt-in/opt-out of features based on what they
specifically want out of this library.

If there is an interest in using this library within other crates and projects, _please
create an [issue](https://github.com/tkatter/sericom)_ so that I can be aware and work towards making it happen.
